\begin{itemize}

  \item We will have problems about fields from sources radiating

    \begin{itemize}

      \item In a source-free region, there are no electric and magnetic fields. That would make Maxwell's equations:

        $$\nabla\cdot\tilde{E}=0$$
        $$\nabla\times\tilde{E}=-j\omega\mu\tilde{H}$$
        $$\nabla\cdot\tilde{H}=0$$
        $$\nabla\times\tilde{H}=\tilde{J}+j\omega\varepsilon\tilde{E}$$

      \item In a region with a source, Maxwell's equations may be written as:

        $$\nabla\cdot\tilde{E}=\frac{\rho_V}{\varepsilon}$$
        $$\nabla\times\tilde{E}=-j\omega\mu\tilde{H}$$
        $$\nabla\cdot\tilde{H}=0$$
        $$\nabla\times\tilde{H}=\tilde{J}_{cond}+j\omega\varepsilon\tilde{E}$$

      \item There are two components that contribute to current density:

        $$\tilde{J}=\tilde{J}_{impressed}+\tilde{J}_{cond}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Impressed is from a source, and conductive is an intrinsic property

            $$\tilde{J}=\sigma\tilde{E}$$

        \end{itemize}
        
      \item The homogenous form of Maxwell's equations can thus be written as:

        $$\nabla\cdot\tilde{E}=0$$
        $$\nabla\times\tilde{E}=-j\omega\mu\tilde{H}$$
        $$\nabla\cdot\tilde{H}=0$$
        $$\nabla\times\tilde{H}=(\sigma+j\omega\varepsilon)\tilde{E}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Far from sources, fields propagate like a plane wave (the circle becomes so large, it can be approximated as a line)

  \item The $\tilde{J}$ conduction component is known as drift

    \begin{itemize}

      \item If the conductivity is non-zero, we can see from the equation above that:

        $$\nabla\times\tilde{H}=j\omega\left( \varepsilon-\frac{j\sigma}{\omega} \right)\tilde{E}$$
        $$\varepsilon_c=\varepsilon-\frac{j\sigma}{\omega}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item If $\frac{\sigma}{\omega}<<\varepsilon$, then the material is an insulator, and:

            $$\varepsilon_c=\varepsilon$$

          \item If $\frac{\sigma}{\omega}>>\varepsilon$, the material is conductive; Note: this means that a good conductor depends on the angular frequency

          \item We can determine that:

            $$\tan(\theta)=\frac{\sigma}{\omega\varepsilon}$$

          \item If the tangent is approximately 0, the conductivity is negligible

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Wave Equations

    \begin{itemize}

      \item From manipulating the first non-zero equation, we get:

        $$\nabla\times\nabla\times\vec{E}-\omega^2\mu\varepsilon_c\tilde{E}=0$$

      \item We can also get:

        $$\nabla^2\vec{E}-\omega\mu\varepsilon_c\tilde{E}=0$$

      \item In lossy media, $\sigma\neq0$ and $\varepsilon_c$ is a complex value. We assign $\gamma=-\omega^2\mu\varepsilon_c$, and can now write:

        $$(\nabla^2-\gamma^2)\tilde{E}=0$$
        $$(\nabla^2-\gamma^2)\tilde{H}=0$$

      \item For lossless media, $\sigma=0$, and $\varepsilon_c$ is purely real

      \item We can rewrite the equation as:

        $$(\nabla^2+k^2)\tilde{E}(r)=0,\text{ where }r=(x,y,z)$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $k$ is the wave number, $\omega\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Mapping from source to field is known as radiation

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A long distance from the source, the spherical wavefront may be approximated to a line

    \end{itemize}

  \item Using one of our equations from above, and plugging in the value of $\nabla\times\tilde{H}$, we can obtain:

    $$\nabla^2\tilde{E}+\omega^2\mu\varepsilon\tilde{E}-j\omega\mu\sigma\tilde{E}=0$$

  \item For plane waves, we end up with two important equations:

    $$\tilde{H}=\frac{1}{\eta}\hat{k}\times\tilde{E}$$
    $$\tilde{E}=-\eta\hat{k}\times\tilde{E}$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Where $\tilde{E}$ and $\tilde{H}$ are plane waves, $\hat{k}$ is the direction of propagation, and $\eta=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\varepsilon}}$. This means we know:

        $$\tilde{E}\cdot\hat{k}=0$$
        $$\tilde{H}\cdot\hat{k}=0$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Polarization

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Occurs when two components or more components of a wave are in different phases

    \end{itemize}

  \item Power Density

    $$S=E\times H\quad\text{(time-dependent)}$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Poynting Vector

        $$P=\oint_A\,dS(\bold{\hat{n}}\cdot S)\quad\text{(in Watts)}$$

      \item For time-harmonic, single frequency:

        $$\tilde{S}=\frac{1}{2}Re\left\{\tilde{E}\times \tilde{H}\right\}\quad\text{(phasors)}$$

      \item The average power density in circuits is similar to this:

        $$P_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}Re\left\{ \tilde{V}\cdot\tilde{I} \right\}$$

      \item The plane-wave average is:

        $$\tilde{S}_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{|\tilde{E}|^2}{\eta}\bold{\hat{z}}\quad\text{(in Watts per square meter)}$$

        where $\eta=\sqrt{\dfrac{\mu}{\varepsilon}}$

      \item In circuits, the expressions are similar:

        $$P_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}Re\left\{ \frac{|\tilde{V}|^2}{z_L} \right\}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item If $z_L$ is real, we can simply write:

            $$P_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{|\tilde{V}|^2}{z_L}$$

          \item For non-real $z_L$, we can write:

            $$P_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{|\tilde{V}|^2}{|z_L|}\cos(\theta)$$

        \end{itemize}

      \item In a lossy medium, we can find:

        $$\tilde{S}_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}|\tilde{E}|^2Re\left\{ \frac{1}{\eta} \right\}=\tilde{S}_{avg}\frac{1}{2}|E_0|^2e^{-2\alpha z}\bold{\hat{z}}\frac{\cos(\theta)}{|\eta|}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Important Formulas

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Some critical formulas for use with plane-waves are:

        $$\alpha=\omega\left[ \frac{\mu\varepsilon\prime}{2}\left[\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\varepsilon\prime\prime}{\varepsilon\prime}\right)^2} -1\right]\right]^\frac{1}{2}$$
        $$\beta=\omega\left[ \frac{\mu\varepsilon\prime}{2}\left[\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\varepsilon\prime\prime}{\varepsilon\prime}\right)^2} +1\right]\right]^\frac{1}{2}$$
        $$\eta=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\varepsilon\prime}}\left( 1-j\frac{\varepsilon\prime\prime}{\varepsilon\prime} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$

      \item If $\alpha=\beta$, then we are dealing with a good conductor

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
