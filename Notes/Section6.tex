\begin{itemize}

  \item Given a phasor wave $\tilde{E}$ and a perpendicular propagation vector $\hat{k}$, we may write:

    $$\tilde{E}=E_o\hat{u}e^{-jk\hat{k}\cdotr}$$
    $$\hat{u}\cdot\hat{k}=0$$
    $$r=(x,y,z)$$

  \item The propagation constant may be defined as:

    $$c_{prop}=\frac{\omega}{c}$$

    where 

    $$c=\frac{c_o}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_r\mu_r}}$$

  \item We will apply transmission line theory to normal incidence and oblique incidence

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The reflection coefficient, $\Gamma$, will be defined relative to the electric field

      \item There is also a transmission coefficient ($\tau$)
        
      \item We can write our formulas as:

        $$\tilde{E}_t=E_o\tau\bold{\hat{x}}e^{-jk_zz}$$
        $$\tilde{H}_t=\frac{E_o\tau}{\eta_2}\bold{\hat{y}}e^{-jk_zz}$$

      \item We can then obtain the reflections

        $$\tilde{E}_r=-\bold{\hat{x}}E_o\Gamma e^{jk_1z}$$
        $$\tilde{H}_r=-\bold{\hat{y}}\frac{E_o\Gamma}{\eta_1} e^{jk_1z}$$

      \item We can also get the formula

        $$1+\Gamma=\tau$$
        $$\Gamma=\frac{\eta_2-\eta_1}{\eta_2+\eta_1}$$
        $$\tau=\frac{2\eta_2}{\eta_2+\eta_1}$$

      \item The Poynting Vector can be redefined as

        $$S_{av}=\frac{\bold{\hat{z}}|E_o|^2}{2\eta_1}\left( 1-|\Gamma|^2 \right)$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Oblique Incidence

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Snell's Laws apply

      \item The index of refraction is:

        $$c=\frac{c_o}{n}$$
        $$n=\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}$$
        $$n_1\sin(\theta_i)=n_2\sin(\theta_t)$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
